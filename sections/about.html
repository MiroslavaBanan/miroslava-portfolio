        <div class="about__inf">
            <p> I started programming when I was twelve. What began as curiosity and a course my parents signed me up
                for quickly became something I genuinely enjoyed. Over time, I moved from small experiments to real
                freelance work, building websites for clients and learning to solve unfamiliar problems. Most of my
                progress came from learning independently and not being afraid to start without knowing everything. </p>
            <p> I've always learned best through practice. One of the most formative projects was a website for a small
                vacation rental business. I integrated third-party services, built admin tools, and adapted to changing
                requirements. This experience taught me how to communicate with non-technical clients, stay flexible,
                and deliver stable solutions others rely on. </p>
            <p> Eventually, I realized I wanted more than working alone on freelance tasks. I wanted to build things
                with people who share the same curiosity. That led me to hackathons, mentoring beginner developers, and
                teaching programming to kids. Through this, I discovered how much I value teamwork, structure, and
                building something meaningful together.
            </p>
            <p> I'm especially interested in how technology can support small businesses and local communities. My
                long-term goal is to create simple, practical tools that help people work more confidently and
                efficiently.
            </p>
            <p> Currently, I'm preparing for a BSc in Computer Science, continuing freelance work, and learning new
                technologies through self-directed study and community projects. I'm focused on growing not only as a
                developer, but also as someone who communicates clearly and works well with others.
